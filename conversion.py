# 1. REBUILD THE RT-1 MODEL ARCHITECTURE IN TENSORFLOW/KERAS
# This is a Keras implementation that mirrors the Flax model from your notebook.
# NOTE: This is a complex part and might require debugging to match perfectly.
# ==============================================================================

# (This section would contain the full TF/Keras implementation of RT1,
#  EfficientNetWithFilm, TransformerBlock, etc. For brevity, we'll assume
#  you have these classes defined. A full implementation is extremely long,
#  but the key is that it must have the same layers in the same order as your
#  Flax model.)

# Placeholder for the complex Keras model definition
# In a real scenario, you would need to translate every Flax nn.Module
# into a tf.keras.Model or tf.keras.layers.Layer class.

# This is a placeholder for the actual weight transfer logic.
# You would need to iterate through the layers of your Keras model and the
# keys of your jax_params dictionary, matching them up.

# For example (highly simplified):
# for tf_layer in tf_model.layers:
#     if isinstance(tf_layer, tf.keras.layers.Dense):
#         # Find the corresponding weights in the JAX PyTree
#         # This requires knowing the exact nested structure of your Flax model
#         jax_kernel = jax_params_np['SomeFlaxModule_0']['Dense_0']['kernel']
#         jax_bias = jax_params_np['SomeFlaxModule_0']['Dense_0']['bias']
#
#         # Set the weights in the Keras layer
#         # Note: You might need to transpose the kernel (weights)
